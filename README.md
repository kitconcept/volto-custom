# volto-custom

This is kitconcept's `volto-custom` package. It contains the customizations that still haven't make into Volto core yet. Some of these features could be that because of their nature, never will make into Volto.

The customizations should have the sufficient markers and comments to determine easily, at first sight what the customization is about, and the estimated time for backport.
